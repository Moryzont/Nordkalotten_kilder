Welcome to an ever-growing treasure trove of historical source material from the northernmost 
reaches of Fenno-Scandinavia, all dating back prior to 1750! ❄️📜 Whether you’re a researcher, a student, 
or simply curious, I hope these documents ignite new insights into this fascinating region. 
If you discover missing sources or have suggestions, please reach out and help this archive thrive. 🙌✨

The project began with a focus on Finnmark, but it quickly became clear that restricting it 
to a single region was too narrow. People in the North have always been remarkably mobile. 
As a result, the scope expanded to include neighboring areas. This repository may be especially 
useful if you’re studying Sámi populations, given that their records are scattered across 
multiple national archives, making any research a profound hazzle.

2. **Look at the sources**  
   Most entries have a link to the digitized document. If not, use the archival reference code to find it yourself.

3. **Mind the Updates**  
   This repository is constantly evolving as new records are found. 
   If you’re using these sources for research, **note the date** you accessed them.

4. **Incomplete by Nature**  
   There’s no way to guarantee every possible record is included here. 
   Consider this a perpetual work in progress!

## Progress ⏳

The aim is to assemble all available source material related to the northernmost parts 
of Scandinavia before 1750. The progress bars below illustrate our current status, 
but keep in mind this collection is a work in progress!
