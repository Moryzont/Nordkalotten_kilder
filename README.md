## How to Use 🔎

1. **Grab the Goods**  
   Download the CSV files from this repository or view them directly in your browser for a quick overview of the source material.

2. **Look at the sources**  
   Most entries have a link to the digitized document. If not, use the archival reference code to find it yourself. Could be tricky. If the link is broken, please reach out! 

3. **Mind the Updates**  
   This repository is constantly evolving as new records are found, labeled, and cataloged. If you’re using these sources for research, **note the date** you accessed them — data may have changed by your next visit. ⏰

4. **Incomplete by Nature**  
   There’s no way to guarantee that every possible record is included here. Lost archives could resurface, new discoveries might pop up in unexpected places, and some sources will inevitably slip through the cracks. Consider this a perpetual work in progress! ✨

## Progress ⏳

The aim is to assemble all available source material related to the northernmost parts of Scandinavia before 1750. The progress bars below illustrate our current status, but keep in mind this collection is a work in progress!
